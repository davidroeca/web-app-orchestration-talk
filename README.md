### Orchestrating React apps and back-ends in a development environment

This repository stores the example source code and presentation source code for
a presentation with the above title, to be given on `September 6, 2018` at the
React NYC Meetup.

### Description

This talk will highlight some patterns to help the development environment
mirror the production environment by using containers and a reverse proxy
image to manage local traffic on a single localhost port. In order to maintain
a usable and flexible development environment, this talk will also highlight
how to incorporate webpack 4, webpack-serve, and hot module replacement in this
environment.
